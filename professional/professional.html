                    In high school, I was drawn to a wide range of subjects, making it difficult to choose a college major. My passion for critical thinking and quantitative analysis was sparked by an AP Micro and Macroeconomics class, which led me to pursue a BS in Economics at Cal Poly, where I also competed in collegiate athletics. Additionally, my interest in environmental conservation inspired me to minor in Sustainability. During my time at Cal Poly, I developed a strong interest in applied subjects, particularly Econometrics and Advanced Econometrics, which combined with linear algebra and statistical courses, helped me understand the practical applications of mathematical concepts. This foundation in data analysis fueled my curiosity, and I took electives in Text Mining, Business Analytics, and ultimately concentrated in Information Systems. These courses introduced me to machine learning techniques, particularly in natural language processing and predictive analytics.

                    Building on my strong foundation in statistical techniques and analytical tools from my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Master’s in Business Analytics to further expand my expertise. This program allowed me to deepen my understanding of the tools that interested me, gain hands-on experience through collaborations with partner companies, and leverage this knowledge to drive business outcomes using analytics and machine learning. I chose CU Boulder for its specialized track in Decision Science, developed in collaboration with the Math Department. A personal factor in my decision was the opportunity to be close to my grandparents, making CU Boulder the perfect choice for my advanced studies.
