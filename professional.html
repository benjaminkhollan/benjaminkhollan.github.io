                <p>Throughout high school, I had a passion for a wide range of subjects, which made selecting a college major challenging. 
                    My interests in applying critical thinking and quantitative analysis were piqued by an AP Micro & Macroeconomics class which led me to pursue a BS in Economics at Cal Poly, where I also engaged in collegiate athletics.
                    Additionally, my commitment to environmental stewardship inspired me to begin a minor in Sustainability, aiming to explore effective conservation strategies for future generations.
                    As my college career progressed, I found myself particularly drawn to applied subjects. My enthusiasm grew during courses like Econometrics and Advanced Econometrics, which were complemented by my studies in linear algebra and other statistical disciplines, illuminating the practical applications of mathematical concepts.
                    My curiosity extended into data analytics, prompting me to take electives in Text Mining, Business Analytics, eventually choosing to concentrate in Information Systems. 
                    These courses introduced me to machine learning techniques applicable in natural language processing and other predictive analytics tools.
