                <h1>Academic Journey</h1>
                <h2>University Experience</h2>
                <p class="indent">Throughout high school, I had a passion for a wide range of subjects, which made selecting a college major challenging. 
                    My interests in applying critical thinking and quantitative analysis were piqued by an AP Micro & Macroeconomics class which led me to pursue a BS in Economics at Cal Poly, where I also engaged in collegiate athletics.
                    Additionally, my commitment to environmental stewardship inspired me to begin a minor in Sustainability, aiming to explore effective conservation strategies for future generations.
                    As my college career progressed, I found myself particularly drawn to applied subjects. My enthusiasm grew during courses like Econometrics and Advanced Econometrics, which were complemented by my studies in linear algebra and other statistical disciplines, illuminating the practical applications of mathematical concepts.
                    My curiosity extended into data analytics, prompting me to take electives in Text Mining, Business Analytics, eventually choosing to concentrate in Information Systems. 
                    These courses introduced me to machine learning techniques applicable in natural language processing and other predictive analytics tools. 
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                Despite my solid foundation in statistical techniques and analytical tools from my undergraduate studies, I was driven by a continuous desire to learn and expand my expertise. 
                This led me to pursue a Master’s in Business Analytics. 
                I chose this path to deepen my understanding of the tools that had piqued my interest, gain practical experience through collaborations with partner companies, and leverage this knowledge to enhance business outcomes through analytics and machine learning.

                I ultimately chose to attend CU Boulder for my graduate studies. The decision was influenced by the specialized track focusing on Decision Science, in collaboration with the Math Department, and the added personal benefit of being close to my grandparents. 
                This program aligned perfectly with my academic and personal goals, providing an ideal setting for my advanced studies.
